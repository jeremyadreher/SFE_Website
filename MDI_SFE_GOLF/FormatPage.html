    <ul> 
        <li> 4-person scramble - Each player tees off with their own ball. After all players have hit, the team will select one of the four tee shots and all players will hit their second shot from within one club-length of that placement. You may not move from one playing surface to another, for example: rough to fairway. Play progresses in this same manner until the ball is holed out.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> Each player must use a minimum of three drives over the 18 holes. Keep track of player's drives used on your scorecard. </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> On the green, all players putt by placing their ball within 6 inches of the selected ball (usually the shortest putt), but no closer to the hole. First ball in counts, please don't putt out the rest of the balls.</li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> Record the team score (per hole) on the scorecard. </li>
    </ul>
