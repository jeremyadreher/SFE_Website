<div style="font-size: 16px">
    <ul> 
        <li> <strong> KP </strong> (Clostest to pin) - There will be men's and women's KP prizes awarded on selected holes. </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> <strong> Longest Drive </strong> - There will be men's and women's Longest Drive prizes on selected holes. Drives must be in the fairway to count. </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> <strong> "Pink Lady" </strong> - One pink ball per team must be in play at all times on every hole. If a pink ball is lost or hit out of bounds, it is considered out of play and, in the case it was hit out of bounds, cannot be used again. Each team signs (with a sharpie) and turns in their remaining pink balls after 18 holes have been played (assuming they have not all been lost or went out of play). These balls are put into a drawing after all teams have reported in. The golfer's name on the ball that is drawn will be awarded a prize. </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> <strong> String Game </strong> - String may be used on the green in lieu of a putt. For example, if a team has a 1-foot putt as their last shot for a hole, they may choose to cut 1-foot off of their remaining length of string (scissors will be provided) and not count that stroke on their scorecard. The 1-foot of string that was used must be disposed of (it cannot be used again on another hole). </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li> <strong> Mulligans </strong> - Mulligan can be purchased for $5.00/each and may be used when a do-over is needed. Golfers may purchase as many Mulligans as desired. </li>
    </ul>
